# Bellman Derivation Playground

An interactive React + TypeScript web app for step-by-step derivation of the Bellman expectation equation in Markov Reward Processes.

## Features
- LaTeX-rendered derivations
- Rule-based step application (lecture-aligned)
- Step history and explanations
- Linear algebra solution: \( V = (I - \gamma P)^{-1} R \)

## Getting started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Educational focus
Designed to make every step in the Bellman derivation explicit and checkable.
